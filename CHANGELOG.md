## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `dist/cubicle.css`: cascade layer order (`reset, tokens, base, layout, components, utilities`),
  a minimal zero-specificity reset, the full `--cb-*` design token set, and a document-level base
  layer (sans typography at 13px, accent links, monospace for `code`/`kbd`/`samp`/`pre`,
  `color-scheme: light`, and the single `:focus-visible` ring).
- `scripts/check-snippets.mjs`: zero-dependency check that every catalogue demo matches its
  copy-paste snippet byte for byte and contains no inline styles.
- `docs/index.html` and `docs/docs.css`: catalogue shell with skip link, sticky navigation,
  Principles, and token reference (colour, depth and shadow, radius, motion and focus, spacing,
  typography) with a base typography demo.
