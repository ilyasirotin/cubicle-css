## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `dist/cubicle.css`: cascade layer order (`reset, tokens, base, layout, components, utilities`),
  a minimal zero-specificity reset, the full `--cb-*` design token set, and a document-level base
  layer (sans typography at 13px, accent links, monospace for `code`/`kbd`/`samp`/`pre`,
  `color-scheme: light`, and the single `:focus-visible` ring).
- `scripts/check-snippets.mjs`: zero-dependency check that every catalogue demo matches its
  copy-paste snippet byte for byte and contains no inline styles.
- `docs/index.html` and `docs/docs.css`: catalogue shell with skip link, sticky navigation,
  Principles, and token reference (colour, depth and shadow, radius, motion and focus, spacing,
  typography) with a base typography demo.
- `scripts/check-tokens.mjs`: zero-dependency check that every token in `@layer tokens` is
  documented in the catalogue with the same value, and that every `var(--cb-*)` reference resolves.
- `dist/cubicle.css` layout layer: application shell `.cb-app` (`__top`, `__side`, `__main`,
  `__status`) as a fixed frame that fills the viewport or its size container and stacks the
  sidebar below 800px; layout primitives `.cb-stack` (`--tight`, `--loose`), `.cb-cluster`
  (`--end`, `--between`) and container-relative `.cb-grid` (`--2`, `--3`, `--4`).
- Tokens `--cb-radius-round` (round status indicators only) and `--cb-duration-spin` (stepped busy
  spinner), with their AGENTS.md rules and catalogue rows.
- Catalogue "Layout & grids" section: live application shell in a size-container frame, stack,
  cluster and grid demos with snippets and reference tables.
